# Artificial Neural Network for clustering human activity

A SOFM (Self-Organizing Feature Maps) is implemented together with the fine-tuning algorithm LVQ (Learning Vector Quantization), which is used to classify the information coming from a dataset that measures different characteristics of the use of smartphones. According to this information, six different types of human activity can be obtained.
